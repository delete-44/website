        I'm Anthony - a software development student currently taking a placement at
        <a href='https://plymouthsoftware.com'>
            Plymouth Software
        </a>, which really means I spend
        most of my time listening to music and struggling with UI design.

        I currently work mostly in 
        <a href='https://rubyonrails.org/'>
            Ruby on Rails
        </a> web apps,
        with plans to expand my skills in mobile development (with a particular interest in AR)
        using 
        <a href='https://flutter.dev'>
            Flutter
        </a>. This site itself is built on
        <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'>
            Jekyll
        </a>
        (which compiles Markdown, Liquid, HTML & SCSS
        into static websites), using 
        <a href='https://tachyons.io'>
            Tachyons
        </a> for styling and
        containerised with 
        <a href='https://www.docker.com'>
            Docker
        </a>
