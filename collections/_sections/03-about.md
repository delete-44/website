Anthony is a software developer and former freelance editor - his experience in both fields has given him an appreciation for close attention to detail and efficiency in the workplace. As such he is a firm believer in the value of small, agile development teams - developing for an MVP with regular meetings to establish targets and achievements is an effective fundamental for running a development team. Equally fundamental is a balance between communication and bureaucracy - this is to prevent either a lack of effective communication or the team being caught up in unnecessary paperwork that infringes on actual development.

Outside of work Anthony is an avid creator and consumer of literature. He specialises in short, introspective fiction and has a growing anthology of poetry. In this he is frequently inspired by music (and indeed spends most of his life with a backing soundtrack) and the emotions evoked, particularly nostalgia and escapism  . His primary experiment in long fiction is a fantasy novella written during college and unfinished at time of writing.
